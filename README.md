# Assessed-task-1-KarhoHenry

In this assessed task, I made use of the Stanford NER to label words in a given input text into 3 categories i.e Person, Location and Organisation. For gathering my input text, I made use of the extract-wiki.py python script  and I ran it in the terminal to direct my outputs to specific text files. The three enteries  which I gathered data for individually are Football, Ocean and Paris. The classified texts can be seen in the individual stanford-ner texts.
