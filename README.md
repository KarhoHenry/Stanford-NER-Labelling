# Stanford NER Labelling 

The Stanford NER Labelling project is a tool designed for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Stanford NER classifier. This tool provides an intuitive interface for annotating and labelling entities in text data, making it easier for researchers and developers to train and evaluate NER models. I made use of the Stanford NER to label words in a given input text into 3 categories i.e Person, Location and Organisation. For gathering my input text, I made use of the extract-wiki.py python script  and I ran it in the terminal to direct my outputs to specific text files. The three enteries  which I gathered data for individually are Football, Ocean and Paris. The classified texts can be seen in the individual stanford-ner texts.
